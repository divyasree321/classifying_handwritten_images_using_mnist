# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project implements a simple yet effective neural network model for classifying handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset**.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
The notebook covers:
- Loading and exploring the MNIST dataset
- Preprocessing image data for neural network training
- Building a fully connected (dense) neural network using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Training and evaluating the model
- Visualizing accuracy and loss curves over epochs

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The trained model effectively classifies MNIST digits, achieving high accuracy on both training and test datasets. Performance metrics and plots are included for analysis.

## ðŸ“š File Included
- `Classifying_handwritten_numbers_using_mnist.ipynb` : Google Colab notebook with full code implementation and outputs.

## ðŸ”— How to Run
- Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
- Run all cells sequentially
- Observe model performance and visualizations
